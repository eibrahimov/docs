Migrating to a new platform might seem overwhelming, but with the right preparation, it can be smooth and efficient. Your goal is to get your existing store data ready for a seamless switch using MigrationPro.

## Key steps to prepare your data

### 1. Conduct an inventory of current store data

First, take stock of all the data in your current store. Consider inventory, orders, customer information, and other critical data. Knowing exactly what you have will help you decide what to bring over.

- **Inventory:** List all products, including SKUs, descriptions, prices, and more.
- **Orders:** Compile a record of all completed, pending, and canceled orders.
- **Customer information:** Gather customer details, such as names, email addresses, and purchase history.

### 2. Choose the data to migrate

Not all data is necessary for your new store. Decide what's essential to transfer, like product listings and customer information, and what can be archived or left behind.

- **Assess the importance:** Focus on data that directly impacts your operations and customer interactions.
- **Avoid data overload:** Unnecessary data can complicate the migration process.

:::caution
Don't leave behind critical data your business relies on.

### 3. Format and export data correctly

Formatting correctly is crucial for successful data migration. MigrationPro supports specific export formats, so make sure your data matches these requirements.

- **Export in supported formats:** Common formats include CSV, XML, or JSON. Check MigrationPro's guidelines specific to your needs.
- **Standardize entries:** Ensure consistent naming conventions and codes across your data sets.
- **Test a sample:** Export a small data set to test compatibility and find any issues before the full migration.

:::tip
Double-check field mappings to ensure your new store correctly interprets your data.
