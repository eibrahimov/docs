Before importing the data to Shopify, make sure it's clean.

1. Open the exported file in a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets.
2. Remove any duplicates or inaccurate data.
3. Format the data to match Shopify's requirements:
   - Make sure email addresses are valid.
   - Confirm phone numbers have the correct format.

### 3. Upload to MigrationPro

With your data ready, it's time to start the migration.

1. Log in to your MigrationPro account.
2. Go to the dashboard and click `Upload file`.
3. Select your cleaned customer data file and click `Upload`.

### 4. Map customer data fields

Accurate mapping ensures that all information ends up in the right place in Shopify.

1. Once the file is uploaded, start the mapping process.
2. Match old platform fields (like first name, email) to Shopify fields.
3. Review all fields and click `Confirm mapping`.

### 5. Verify and finish

After mapping, verify that everything is correct.

1. Start the migration process within MigrationPro.
2. Once completed, review the migrated data in Shopify:
   - Check customer accounts.
   - Validate order histories and details.

:::tip
You can always test the migration with a few records first to ensure everything is set up correctly.
