## Key steps

### 1. Audit migrated data for discrepancies

1. Go to your Shopify admin and click on **Settings**.
2. Select **Data management** to view your recently migrated data.

### 2. Use troubleshooting guides

1. Refer to Shopify's help center or migration tool documentation specific to your app for troubleshooting guides.
2. Follow the recommended procedures to address common issues like missing images or SKU errors.
3. If a new issue arises, reach out to support via email at [support@migration.io](mailto:support@migration.io) for personalized advice.

:::caution
Re-migrating without resolving current errors may cause data duplication. Always clear existing data by selecting the **Clear current data on target store** option before starting a full re-migration.

### 3. Verify resolution through sampling

1. After applying fixes, check a small sample of your data for accuracy:
   - Go to **Products** in your Shopify admin and randomly select items to verify their details.
   - Ensure orders processed through the migration path display correct customer information and order history.
2. If errors persist in the sample, revisit the troubleshooting guides to resolve them before proceeding.

Remember, running a **Recent data migration** can help if thereâ€™s new data added after your initial migration. This ensures all the latest changes are captured.

By following these steps, you can minimize disruption and keep your Shopify store's data aligned perfectly with your business needs.
