# Customizing migration settings

When you're migrating your store to Shopify, you may have unique requirements for your business. Customizing migration settings lets you tailor the migration process to fit your needs. This guide will help you access and modify these settings effectively.

## Learning objectives

- Access and modify advanced settings
- Tailor migration to fit your store's specific needs
- Understand the implications of custom settings

## Navigating to advanced settings

1. **Open the MigrationPro app**: Log in to your Shopify admin panel and go to the `MigrationPro` app.
2. **Access configuration**: From the `MigrationPro` dashboard, click `Next: Configure Your Migration`.
3. **Enter advanced settings**: Find the `Advanced Settings` option on the configuration page to start customization.

## Altering settings as needed

1. **Select additional options**: Choose the options you want to add to your migration configuration, like `Target Store Data Reset` or `Migrate Content Images`.
2. **Customize specific entities**: For specialized migrations, choose specific groups of entities (like products, customers, orders) that need adjustments.
3. **Confirm settings**: Once you've set your custom settings, review them for accuracy before continuing with the migration.

## Test changes thoroughly before proceeding

1. **Perform a demo migration**: Run a `Demo Migration` to test if your custom settings work as expected. This step helps ensure the configurations meet your storeâ€™s requirements.
2. **Review results**: After the test migration, check the `Demo Report` to verify that everything has transferred accurately according to your settings.
3. **Refine if needed**: If issues arise, revisit your settings in the advanced configurations and adjust them as necessary.

:::caution
Change settings cautiously, as some configurations might lead to data discrepancies if they're not applied correctly.

## Starting the migration
