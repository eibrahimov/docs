## Introduction

Thinking about migrating your Shopify store? Running a test migration is a great first step. By doing a trial migration, you can make sure everything's set up right before going all in. This guide walks you through the process of a test migration, helps you understand its purpose, and ensures you're ready for the full migration.

## Learning objectives

- Understand the purpose of a test migration.
- Perform a test migration easily.
- Evaluate the results to make sure everything's accurate.

## Steps to perform a test migration

Follow these steps to carry out a test migration:

1. **Start a sample data migration**

    - Log in to your migration tool. 
    - Go to `Migrations` and select `Create new migration`.
    - Choose the `Demo migration` option to start with sample data.

    :::tip
    Demo migrations are free until you purchase the migration tool.
    :::

2. **Monitor the migration process**

    - After starting, watch the migration process. 
    - Look for any warnings or errors that might appear. 
    - You can pause if needed to address immediate issues.

3. **Review migrated data for accuracy and integrity**

    - After the demo migration, check the migrated data.
    - Look at key elements like products, categories, and orders for accuracy.
    - Make sure custom fields and specific configurations migrated correctly.

4. **Identify discrepancies or errors**

    - Find discrepancies between your source and target store.
    - Note any errors or missing data.
    
    :::caution
    If you find discrepancies, they might indicate issues for the full migration. Address these before moving on.
    :::

5. **Make necessary adjustments before full migration**

    - If you notice errors, correct them in your source store or update your migration settings.
    - Test again if needed to be confident in your setup.

6. **Get ready for full migration**

    - After fixing all issues and confirming data integrity in the test migration, prepare for the full migration.
    - Select the `Clear current data on target store` option to avoid duplicate data.

    :::tip
    Doing a recent data migration before deactivating the source store can help keep both stores in sync with the latest data.

By running a test migration, you ensure a smoother transition for your Shopify store with minimized risks. Happy migrating!
