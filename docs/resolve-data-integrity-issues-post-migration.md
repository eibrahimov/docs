   Fix each discrepancy by either manually updating records in Shopify or using CSV files for bulk updates.

   - To make manual updates, navigate to `Products`, `Orders`, or `Customers` in Shopify, find the necessary entries, and make the edits.
   - To perform bulk updates, use the `Import` feature in each section to update data using corrected CSV files.
