## Steps to prepare your data for migration

1. **List all data categories to migrate**  
   First, make a list of all the data types you'll be migrating. Common categories include products, customers, orders, and any custom pages or content you have. Be thorough to avoid leaving anything important behind.

   :::tip
   Make sure to check Shopify's data guidelines to see what formats and types are supported.

2. **Verify data's compatibility with Shopify**  
   Not all data types can move directly to Shopify without changes. Double-check that your data complies with Shopify’s structure and requirements. Adjust any data that might not fit.

   :::caution
   Some custom data types may require specialized tools or manual adjustments to import properly.

3. **Cleanse data, removing duplicates and errors**  
   Go through your data to remove any duplicates or errors. A clean dataset helps avoid problems during migration. Look for duplicate records, outdated information, and any errors that need fixing.

   :::tip
   Use spreadsheet tools like Excel or Google Sheets to easily search for duplicates.
   :::

4. **Use tools to export data into supported formats**  
   After cleaning, use appropriate tools to export your data into Shopify-supported formats. CSV is a commonly supported format for most data types.

   :::tip
   Shopify provides import/export apps that can help streamline this process. Consider using them for bulk data.

5. **Securely back up your data before proceeding**  
   Before making any migrations, ensure you have a secure backup of all your data. This way, if anything goes wrong, you can restore your original data quickly.

   :::caution
   Always store backups in a secure location, and, if possible, have more than one backup in different locations.
   :::

Once your data is prepped and backed up, you're ready to begin the migration process to your new Shopify store. Ensuring your data is clean and correctly formatted will make the transition smoother and help avoid potential headaches later on.
