Congratulations on taking the next big step in growing your online store! Migrating to Shopify lets you harness the power of a robust e-commerce platform. This guide will walk you through executing your data migration using MigrationPro, ensuring everything moves smoothly and accurately.

## Learning objectives

- Execute a complete migration using MigrationPro.

## Key steps

### 1. Initiate the data migration process

1. **Access your MigrationPro dashboard.**  
   Log in to your Shopify account and open the MigrationPro app from your dashboard.

2. **Select migration type.**  
   Decide if you want to run a demo migration to see how things will look or jump straight into a full migration if you’re ready.

   **Tip:** Running a demo migration first can help identify potential issues without affecting your live store.

3. **Configure additional options.**  
   When prompted, carefully choose the additional options for your migration configuration. This might include selecting 'Clear current data on Target Store' to avoid duplicates.

### 2. Monitor migration progress

1. **Start the migration.**  
   Click on Start Full Migration once you’ve reviewed and confirmed all settings.

2. **Check progress.**  
   Keep an eye on the progress bar provided in the MigrationPro app. This indicates how much data has been migrated.

### 3. Verify and clean up any discrepancies

1. **Complete the setup.**  
   After the migration is done, click Complete Setup to finalize your migration. This action verifies the credentials and confirms all data is accessible in your Shopify admin dashboard.

2. **Verify data integrity.**  
   Ensure that all data has been correctly imported. Check products, customer details, and orders to confirm everything is correct.

   **Caution:** Remigration can create duplicates. Select the appropriate settings to prevent re-importing data.

3. **Handle post-migration issues.**  
   If you find any discrepancies, address them promptly. Reach out to MigrationPro support if problems persist.
