# Validating store data

Ensure your store data is accurate and complete after migration.

## Introduction

Migrating your store data to Shopify is a big step. It's crucial to make sure all your data transferred correctly and nothing important is missing. Here's a simple guide to help you verify data accuracy, fix any discrepancies, and maintain data integrity across your databases.

## Step-by-step instructions

   - Export your original data from the source store.
   - In Shopify, go to `Products`, `Customers`, and `Orders` to download the corresponding data.

2. **Use Shopify reporting tools**
   - Go to your Shopify admin and click `Analytics`.
   - Use the `Reports` section to check data summaries and statistical accuracy.
   - Note any anomalies or unexpected figures.

3. **Amend data errors**
   - If you find discrepancies during your cross-check, return to `Products`, `Customers`, or `Orders`.
   - Use the `Edit` feature to make corrections.
   - Ensure the changes save properly.
