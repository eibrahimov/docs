   1. Navigate to your store's frontend and simulate a purchase. Check if the shopping cart, checkout process, and payment gateways work as expected.
   2. Verify that automated emails, like order confirmations and shipping notifications, are sent correctly.
   3. Test all links and buttons to ensure they're responsive and direct users to the right places.
